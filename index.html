      <h2>Shakespeare and his life</h2>
      <p class="intro">
        William Shakespeare is a world renowned poet, lyricist (one who writes the words to a popular song or musical), author, dramaturge (one who writes and plans a solemn play), actor and a playwright (one who writes and plans a play) who was born in April, 1564 in Stratford-Upon-Avon, England. His exact date of birth is unknown, but is commonly celebrated on the 23rd of April. His parents are John Shakespear and Mary Arden. Shakespeare was the eldest of the family, as his two elder sisters were unfortunately lost when they were infants. When Shakespeare turned 18, he married Anne Hathaway and had Susanna, Judith and Hamnet Shakespeare. Unfortunately, Hamnet died at a young age of 11. Shakespeare’s wealth and famousness started primarily in London. No one really knows what he did in London to become so wealthy, but we do know that he published two poems there, Venus and Adonis, and The Rape of Lucrece. He also founded the company The Lord Chamberlain’s Lair.

      <h2>Shakespeare's Influencers</h2>
      <p class="intro">
        Shakespeare has had many major influences throughout his life, all of which influenced him on his plays and poems. An example of this is Christopher Marlowe. This individual invented the use of blank verses, which Shakespeare uses throughout all of his plays. Marlowe also wrote plays, and was only a few months older than Shakespeare, making them relatable to each other. However, after Marlowe’s early death at the age of 23, Shakespeare was thought to be devastated. He acknowledged his friend by quoting his poems and describing his death in one of his plays, As You Like It. Also, as you may have heard before, Shakespear’s son, Hamnet, tragically died at a young age of 11, causing Shakespeare to fall into a period of depression. To acknowledge his son, he wrote one of the most famous plays in the history of plays ever, Hamlet. Before Hamnet’s death, he was writing comedies, but a few years later, he wrote many notable tragedies, many of which are well known today. So, as you can see, many people helped Shakespeare along his journey to success and to the person most people see him as today.

      <h2>What is a famous historical event that shaped Shakespeare?</h2>
      <p class="intro">
        One major event that happened in Shakespeare’s life was Queen Elizabeth the 1st becoming queen. The major things that she did to influence Shakespeare was to encourage plays and to support theaters. She did this, as she really enjoyed theatre and the Puritans made them illegal, as they were in power at the time. She also majorly influenced a famous play, A Midsummer's Night dream.
